Example effects of sequential vs scattered memory access
use the program and vary the parameters, while keeping the time

memory_access_test <num_elements> <num_rounds> <sequential>

num_elements: number of elements to allocatr (pick some large number)
num_rounds:   number of times to perform the test
sequential:   0: random access, 1: sequential access
