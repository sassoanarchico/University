     * - you can read from a FIFO as from a regular file descriptor
     * - since you don't know the length of the message, just
     *   read one byte at a time from the socket
     * - leave the cycle when 'separator' ('\n') is encountered
     * - repeat the read() when interrupted before reading any data
     * - return the number of bytes read
     * - reading 0 bytes means that the other process has closed
     *   the FIFO unexpectedly: this is an error that should be
     *   dealt with!
